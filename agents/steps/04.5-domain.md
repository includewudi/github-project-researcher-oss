# Step 4.5: Domain Fitness Evaluation

> **返回索引:** [SKILL_FULL.md](../../SKILL_FULL.md)

**When to Use:** When evaluating if a project fits a SPECIFIC domain different from its original intent.

This step was evolved from evaluating Qlib (stock quant) for cryptocurrency trading.

## 4.5.1 Domain Gap Analysis

Compare project's native domain vs target domain:

| Aspect | Project's Native Domain | Target Domain | Gap |
|--------|-------------------------|---------------|-----|
| Data Format | {e.g., OHLCV daily} | {e.g., tick data, orderbook} | {Low/Medium/High} |
| Data Source | {e.g., Yahoo Finance} | {e.g., Exchange WebSocket} | {Low/Medium/High} |
| Trading Hours | {e.g., Market hours only} | {e.g., 24/7} | {Low/Medium/High} |
| Instruments | {e.g., Stocks, ETFs} | {e.g., Crypto pairs, perpetuals} | {Low/Medium/High} |
| Latency Requirements | {e.g., End-of-day} | {e.g., Sub-second} | {Low/Medium/High} |

## 4.5.2 Component Reusability Matrix

Evaluate each major component for the target domain:

| Component | Reusable? | Modification Needed | Effort |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------|--------|
| Data Pipeline | ✅/⚠️/❌ | {description} | {Easy/Medium/Hard} |
| Feature Engine | ✅/⚠️/❌ | {description} | {Easy/Medium/Hard} |
| Model Framework | ✅/⚠️/❌ | {description} | {Easy/Medium/Hard} |
| Backtester | ✅/⚠️/❌ | {description} | {Easy/Medium/Hard} |
| Execution | ✅/⚠️/❌ | {description} | {Easy/Medium/Hard} |

Legend:
- ✅ Fully reusable as-is
- ⚠️ Reusable with modifications
- ❌ Need replacement

## 4.5.3 Adaptation Strategies

Based on gap analysis, recommend adaptation approach:

### Strategy A: Wrap & Extend
- Use project's core (models, features) 
- Replace periphery (data, execution) with domain-specific tools
- Example: Qlib models + FreqTrade data/execution for crypto

### Strategy B: Fork & Modify
- Fork the project
- Modify internals for domain requirements
- Maintain as separate branch
- Risk: Merge conflicts with upstream

### Strategy C: Hybrid Architecture
- Pick best components from multiple projects
- Build glue layer between them
- Example: Qlib feature engine + ccxt data + custom backtester

### Strategy D: Inspiration Only
- Project not directly usable
- Extract patterns/ideas for custom implementation
- Document learnings for own build

## 4.5.4 Domain Fitness Score

Rate fitness for the specific target domain:

```
DOMAIN FITNESS ASSESSMENT: {Project} for {Target Domain}

Data Compatibility:     /10  {native data format matches?}
Execution Model:        /10  {trading mechanics compatible?}
Latency Profile:        /10  {speed requirements met?}
Feature Reusability:    /10  {ML features applicable?}
Backtesting Validity:   /10  {backtest assumptions valid?}
Community Support:      /10  {domain-specific examples exist?}
--------------------------------
Domain Fitness Score:   /60

Recommendation: {Use As-Is / Adapt / Hybrid / Build Custom}
Estimated Adaptation Effort: {1 week / 1 month / 3 months / 6 months}
```
